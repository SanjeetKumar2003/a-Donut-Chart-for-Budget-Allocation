Problem Statement:

You are a data analyst working for a small startup company.
The CEO has asked you to create a visual representation of the company's
budget allocation for the upcoming fiscal year.
The budget is divided into five main categories: Marketing, Research &
Development, Operations, Human Resources, and IT Infrastructure.
Your task is to create a donut chart using Python that clearly shows the
percentage allocation for each category.
The CEO wants to be able to quickly understand how the budget is
distributed across these key areas.
Please write a Python script that:
Creates sample data for the budget allocation
Uses matplotlib to generate a donut chart
Displays the percentage for each category within the chart
Uses a color scheme that is easy to distinguish
Includes a legend for easy reference
Ensure that your code is efficient and well-commented.
The chart should be visually appealing and easy to interpret at a glance.
